    <verse number="1">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</verse>
    <verse number="2">To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</verse>
    <verse number="3">To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; {equity: Heb. equities}</verse>
    <verse number="4">To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. {discretion: or, advisement}</verse>
    <verse number="5">A wise {man} will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</verse>
    <verse number="6">To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. {the interpretation: or, an eloquent speech}</verse>
    <verse number="7">The fear of the LORD {is} the beginning of knowledge: {but} fools despise wisdom and instruction. {the beginning: or, the principal part}</verse>
    <verse number="8">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</verse>
    <verse number="9">For they {shall be} an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. {an...: Heb. an adding}</verse>
    <verse number="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</verse>
    <verse number="11">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</verse>
    <verse number="12">Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</verse>
    <verse number="13">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</verse>
    <verse number="14">Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</verse>
    <verse number="15">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</verse>
    <verse number="16">For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</verse>
    <verse number="17">Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. {in the...: Heb. in the eyes of every thing that hath a wing}</verse>
    <verse number="18">And they lay wait for their {own} blood; they lurk privily for their {own} lives.</verse>
    <verse number="19">So {are} the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; {which} taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</verse>
    <verse number="20">Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: {Wisdom: Heb. Wisdoms, that is, Excellent wisdom}</verse>
    <verse number="21">She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, {saying},</verse>
    <verse number="22">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
    <verse number="23">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</verse>
    <verse number="24">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</verse>
    <verse number="25">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</verse>
    <verse number="26">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</verse>
    <verse number="27">When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</verse>
    <verse number="28">Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</verse>
    <verse number="29">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</verse>
    <verse number="30">They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</verse>
    <verse number="31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</verse>
    <verse number="32">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. {turning...: or, ease of the simple}</verse>
    <verse number="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</verse>

    <verse number="14">Who rejoice to do evil, {and} delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</verse>
    <verse number="15">Whose ways {are} crooked, and {they} froward in their paths:</verse>

    <verse number="20">That thou mayest walk in the way of good {men}, and keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>

    <verse number="1">My son, attend unto my wisdom, {and} bow thine ear to my understanding:</verse>
    <verse number="2">That thou mayest regard discretion, and {that} thy lips may keep knowledge.</verse>
    <verse number="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop {as} an honeycomb, and her mouth {is} smoother than oil: {mouth: Heb. palate}</verse>

    <verse number="20">And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</verse>

    <verse number="22">When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and {when} thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</verse>
    <verse number="23">For the commandment {is} a lamp; and the law {is} light; and reproofs of instruction {are} the way of life: {lamp: or, candle}</verse>

    <verse number="23">Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it {is} for his life.</verse>
