  <chapter number="1">
    <verse number="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
    <verse number="2">To Timothy, {my} dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, {and} peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
    <verse number="3">I thank God, whom I serve from {my} forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</verse>
    <verse number="4">Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; {Greatly...: or, remembering thy tears, I greatly desire to see thee that}</verse>
    <verse number="5">When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</verse>
    <verse number="6">Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</verse>
    <verse number="7">For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</verse>
    <verse number="8">Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</verse>
    <verse number="9">Who hath saved us, and called {us} with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</verse>
    <verse number="10">But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</verse>
    <verse number="11">Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</verse>
    <verse number="12">For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. {believed: or, trusted}</verse>
    <verse number="13">Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse number="14">That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</verse>
    <verse number="15">This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</verse>
    <verse number="16">The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</verse>
    <verse number="17">But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found {me}.</verse>
    <verse number="18">The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter number="2">
    <verse number="1">Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse number="2">And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. {among: or, by}</verse>
    <verse number="3">Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse number="4">No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of {this} life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</verse>
    <verse number="5">And if a man also strive for masteries, {yet} is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</verse>
    <verse number="6">The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. {that...: or, labouring first, must be partaker of the fruits}</verse>
    <verse number="7">Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</verse>
    <verse number="8">Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</verse>
    <verse number="9">Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, {even} unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
    <verse number="10">Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
    <verse number="11">{It is} a faithful saying: For if we be dead with {him}, we shall also live with {him}:</verse>
    <verse number="12">If we suffer, we shall also reign with {him}: if we deny {him}, he also will deny us:</verse>
    <verse number="13">If we believe not, {yet} he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</verse>
    <verse number="14">Of these things put {them} in remembrance, charging {them} before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, {but} to the subverting of the hearers.</verse>
    <verse number="15">Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</verse>
    <verse number="16">But shun profane {and} vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</verse>
    <verse number="17">And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; {canker: or, gangrene}</verse>
    <verse number="18">Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</verse>
    <verse number="19">Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. {sure: or, steady}</verse>
    <verse number="20">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</verse>
    <verse number="21">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, {and} prepared unto every good work.</verse>
    <verse number="22">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
    <verse number="23">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</verse>
    <verse number="24">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all {men}, apt to teach, patient, {patient: or, forbearing}</verse>
    <verse number="25">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</verse>
    <verse number="26">And {that} they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. {recover...: Gr. awake} {taken...: Gr. taken alive}</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter number="3">
    <verse number="1">This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</verse>
    <verse number="2">For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</verse>
    <verse number="3">Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, {false...: or, one who foments strife}</verse>
    <verse number="4">Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</verse>
    <verse number="5">Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</verse>
    <verse number="6">For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</verse>
    <verse number="7">Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
    <verse number="8">Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. {reprobate: or, of no judgment}</verse>
    <verse number="9">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all {men}, as theirs also was.</verse>
    <verse number="10">But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, {fully...: or, been a diligent follower of}</verse>
    <verse number="11">Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of {them} all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
    <verse number="12">Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</verse>
    <verse number="13">But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</verse>
    <verse number="14">But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned {them};</verse>
    <verse number="15">And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse number="16">All scripture {is} given by inspiration of God, and {is} profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</verse>
    <verse number="17">That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. {throughly...: or, perfected}</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter number="4">
    <verse number="1">I charge {thee} therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</verse>
    <verse number="2">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</verse>
    <verse number="3">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</verse>
    <verse number="4">And they shall turn away {their} ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</verse>
    <verse number="5">But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. {make...; or, fulfil}</verse>
    <verse number="6">For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</verse>
    <verse number="7">I have fought a good fight, I have finished {my} course, I have kept the faith:</verse>
    <verse number="8">Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</verse>
    <verse number="9">Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</verse>
    <verse number="10">For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</verse>
    <verse number="11">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</verse>
    <verse number="12">And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</verse>
    <verse number="13">The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring {with thee}, and the books, {but} especially the parchments.</verse>
    <verse number="14">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</verse>
    <verse number="15">Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words. {our words: or, our preachings}</verse>
    <verse number="16">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all {men} forsook me: {I pray God} that it may not be laid to their charge.</verse>
    <verse number="17">Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and {that} all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
    <verse number="18">And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve {me} unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom {be} glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
    <verse number="19">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</verse>
    <verse number="20">Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</verse>
    <verse number="21">Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
    <verse number="22">The Lord Jesus Christ {be} with thy spirit. Grace {be} with you. Amen. «{The second epistle} unto Timotheus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians, was written from Rome, when Paul was brought before Nero the second time.»</verse>
