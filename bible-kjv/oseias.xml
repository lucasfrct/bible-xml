  <chapter number="1">
    <verse number="1">The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, {and} Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
    <verse number="2">The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, {departing} from the LORD.</verse>
    <verse number="3">So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.</verse>
    <verse number="4">And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little {while}, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. {avenge: Heb. visit}</verse>
    <verse number="5">And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
    <verse number="6">And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And {God} said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away. {Loruhamah: that is, Not having obtained mercy} {no...: Heb. not add any more to} {but...: or, that I should altogether pardon them}</verse>
    <verse number="7">But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</verse>
    <verse number="8">Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</verse>
    <verse number="9">Then said {God}, Call his name Loammi: for ye {are} not my people, and I will not be your {God}. {Loammi: that is, Not my people}</verse>
    <verse number="10">Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, {that} in the place where it was said unto them, Ye {are} not my people, {there} it shall be said unto them, {Ye are} the sons of the living God. {in...: or, instead of that}</verse>
    <verse number="11">Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great {shall be} the day of Jezreel.</verse>

  <chapter number="2">
    <verse number="1">Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah. {Ammi: that is, My people} {Ruhamah: that is, Having obtained mercy}</verse>
    <verse number="2">Plead with your mother, plead: for she {is} not my wife, neither {am} I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</verse>
    <verse number="3">Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</verse>
    <verse number="4">And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they {be} the children of whoredoms.</verse>
    <verse number="5">For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give {me} my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink. {drink: Heb. drinks}</verse>
    <verse number="6">Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths. {make...: Heb. wall a wall}</verse>
    <verse number="7">And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find {them}: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then {was it} better with me than now.</verse>
    <verse number="8">For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, {which} they prepared for Baal. {wine: Heb. new wine} {which...: or, wherewith they made &lt;a href="/dicionario/Baal/"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;}</verse>
    <verse number="9">Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax {given} to cover her nakedness. {recover: or, take away}</verse>
    <verse number="10">And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand. {lewdness: Heb. folly, or, villany}</verse>
    <verse number="11">I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</verse>
    <verse number="12">And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These {are} my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. {destroy: Heb. make desolate}</verse>
    <verse number="13">And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse number="14">Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. {comfortably: or, friendly: Heb. to her heart}</verse>
    <verse number="15">And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse number="16">And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, {that} thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali. {Ishi: that is, My husband} {Baali: that is, My lord}</verse>
    <verse number="17">For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</verse>
    <verse number="18">And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and {with} the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</verse>
    <verse number="19">And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</verse>
    <verse number="20">I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.</verse>
    <verse number="21">And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</verse>
    <verse number="22">And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.</verse>
    <verse number="23">And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to {them which were} not my people, Thou {art} my people; and they shall say, {Thou art} my God.</verse>

  <chapter number="3">
    <verse number="1">Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of {her} friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine. {of wine: Heb. of grapes}</verse>
    <verse number="2">So I bought her to me for fifteen {pieces} of silver, and {for} an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: {half...: Heb. lethech}</verse>
    <verse number="3">And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for {another} man: so {will} I also {be} for thee.</verse>
    <verse number="4">For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and {without} teraphim: {image: Heb. a standing, or, statue, or, pillar}</verse>
    <verse number="5">Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter number="4">
    <verse number="1">Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because {there is} no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
    <verse number="2">By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. {blood: Heb. bloods}</verse>
    <verse number="3">Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</verse>
    <verse number="4">Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people {are} as they that strive with the priest.</verse>

    <verse number="6">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. {destroyed: Heb. cut off}</verse>
    <verse number="7">As they were increased, so they sinned against me: {therefore} will I change their glory into shame.</verse>
    <verse number="8">They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity. {set...: Heb. lift up their soul to}</verse>
    <verse number="9">And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings. {punish: Heb. visit upon} {reward: Heb. cause to return}</verse>
    <verse number="10">For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</verse>
    <verse number="11">Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</verse>
    <verse number="12">My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused {them} to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</verse>
    <verse number="13">They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof {is} good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</verse>
    <verse number="14">I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people {that} doth not understand shall fall. {I will not: or, Shall I not} {fall: or, be punished}</verse>
    <verse number="15">Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, {yet} let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.</verse>

  <chapter number="5">
    <verse number="1">Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment {is} toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</verse>

    <verse number="11">Ephraim {is} oppressed {and} broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</verse>
    <verse number="12">Therefore {will} I {be} unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. {rottenness: or, a worm}</verse>

    <verse number="14">For I {will be} unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, {even} I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue {him}.</verse>
    <verse number="15">I will go {and} return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early. {acknowledge...: Heb. be guilty}</verse>
