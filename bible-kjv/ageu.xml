    <verse number="3">Who {is} left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? {is it} not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?</verse>
    <verse number="4">Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I {am} with you, saith the LORD of hosts:</verse>
    <verse number="5">{According to} the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.</verse>
    <verse number="6">For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it {is} a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry {land};</verse>
    <verse number="7">And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>

    <verse number="11">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests {concerning} the law, saying,</verse>
    <verse number="12">If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</verse>

    <verse number="14">Then answered Haggai, and said, So {is} this people, and so {is} this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so {is} every work of their hands; and that which they offer there {is} unclean.</verse>
    <verse number="15">And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:</verse>
    <verse number="16">Since those {days} were, when {one} came to an heap of twenty {measures}, there were {but} ten: when {one} came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty {vessels} out of the press, there were {but} twenty.</verse>

    <verse number="21">Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;</verse>
    <verse number="22">And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.</verse>
    <verse number="23">In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
