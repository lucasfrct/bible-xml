  <chapter number="1">
    <verse number="1">Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</verse>
    <verse number="2">And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</verse>
    <verse number="3">Grace {be} to you and peace from God the Father, and {from} our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
    <verse number="4">Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</verse>
    <verse number="5">To whom {be} glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
    <verse number="6">I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</verse>
    <verse number="7">Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
    <verse number="8">But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</verse>
    <verse number="9">As we said before, so say I now again, If any {man} preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</verse>
    <verse number="10">For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</verse>
    <verse number="11">But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</verse>
    <verse number="12">For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught {it}, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse number="13">For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</verse>
    <verse number="14">And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. {equals: Gr. equals in years}</verse>
    <verse number="15">But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called {me} by his grace,</verse>
    <verse number="16">To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</verse>
    <verse number="17">Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</verse>
    <verse number="18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. {went up: or, returned}</verse>
    <verse number="19">But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.</verse>
    <verse number="20">Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</verse>
    <verse number="21">Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</verse>
    <verse number="22">And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</verse>
    <verse number="23">But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</verse>
    <verse number="24">And they glorified God in me.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter number="2">
    <verse number="1">Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with {me} also.</verse>
    <verse number="2">And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. {privately: or, severally}</verse>
    <verse number="3">But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</verse>
    <verse number="4">And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</verse>
    <verse number="5">To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</verse>
    <verse number="6">But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed {to be somewhat} in conference added nothing to me:</verse>
    <verse number="7">But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as {the gospel} of the circumcision {was} unto Peter;</verse>
    <verse number="8">(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</verse>
    <verse number="9">And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we {should go} unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</verse>
    <verse number="10">Only {they would} that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.</verse>
    <verse number="11">But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</verse>
    <verse number="12">For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</verse>
    <verse number="13">And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</verse>
    <verse number="14">But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before {them} all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</verse>
    <verse number="15">We {who are} Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</verse>
    <verse number="16">Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</verse>
    <verse number="17">But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, {is} therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</verse>
    <verse number="18">For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</verse>
    <verse number="19">For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</verse>
    <verse number="20">I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</verse>
    <verse number="21">I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness {come} by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter number="3">
    <verse number="1">O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</verse>
    <verse number="2">This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
    <verse number="3">Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</verse>
    <verse number="4">Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if {it be} yet in vain. {so many: or, so great}</verse>
    <verse number="5">He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, {doeth he it} by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
    <verse number="6">Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. {accounted: or, imputed}</verse>
    <verse number="7">Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</verse>
    <verse number="8">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, {saying}, In thee shall all nations be blessed.</verse>
    <verse number="9">So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</verse>
    <verse number="10">For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed {is} every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</verse>
    <verse number="11">But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, {it is} evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</verse>
    <verse number="12">And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.</verse>
    <verse number="13">Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed {is} every one that hangeth on a tree:</verse>
    <verse number="14">That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
    <verse number="15">Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though {it be} but a man's covenant, yet {if it be} confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. {covenant: or, testament}</verse>
    <verse number="16">Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</verse>
    <verse number="17">And this I say, {that} the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</verse>
    <verse number="18">For if the inheritance {be} of the law, {it is} no more of promise: but God gave {it} to Abraham by promise.</verse>
    <verse number="19">Wherefore then {serveth} the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; {and it was} ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</verse>
    <verse number="20">Now a mediator is not {a mediator} of one, but God is one.</verse>
    <verse number="21">{Is} the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</verse>
    <verse number="22">But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</verse>
    <verse number="23">But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</verse>
    <verse number="24">Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster {to bring us} unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
    <verse number="25">But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</verse>
    <verse number="26">For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse number="27">For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</verse>
    <verse number="28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse number="29">And if ye {be} Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter number="4">
    <verse number="1">Now I say, {That} the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</verse>
    <verse number="2">But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</verse>
    <verse number="3">Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: {elements: or, rudiments}</verse>
    <verse number="4">But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</verse>
    <verse number="5">To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</verse>
    <verse number="6">And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</verse>
    <verse number="7">Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</verse>
    <verse number="8">Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</verse>
    <verse number="9">But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? {turn ye again: or, turn ye back} {elements: or, rudiments}</verse>
    <verse number="10">Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.</verse>
    <verse number="11">I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</verse>
    <verse number="12">Brethren, I beseech you, be as I {am}; for I {am} as ye {are}: ye have not injured me at all.</verse>
    <verse number="13">Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.</verse>
    <verse number="14">And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, {even} as Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse number="15">Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if {it had been} possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. {Where...: or, What was then}</verse>
    <verse number="16">Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</verse>
    <verse number="17">They zealously affect you, {but} not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them. {exclude you: or, exclude us}</verse>
    <verse number="18">But {it is} good to be zealously affected always in {a} good {thing}, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
    <verse number="19">My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,</verse>
    <verse number="20">I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you. {I stand...: or, I am perplexed for you}</verse>
    <verse number="21">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</verse>
    <verse number="22">For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</verse>
    <verse number="23">But he {who was} of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman {was} by promise.</verse>
    <verse number="24">Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. {covenants: or, testaments} {Sinai: Gr. Sina}</verse>
    <verse number="25">For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. {answereth to: or, is in the same rank with}</verse>
    <verse number="26">But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</verse>
    <verse number="27">For it is written, Rejoice, {thou} barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.</verse>
    <verse number="28">Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</verse>
    <verse number="29">But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him {that was born} after the Spirit, even so {it is} now.</verse>
    <verse number="30">Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</verse>
    <verse number="31">So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter number="5">
    <verse number="1">Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</verse>
    <verse number="2">Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</verse>
    <verse number="3">For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
    <verse number="4">Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</verse>
    <verse number="5">For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</verse>
    <verse number="6">For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</verse>
    <verse number="7">Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? {hinder you: or, drive you back}</verse>
    <verse number="8">This persuasion {cometh} not of him that calleth you.</verse>
    <verse number="9">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</verse>
    <verse number="10">I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</verse>
    <verse number="11">And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.</verse>
    <verse number="12">I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</verse>
    <verse number="13">For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only {use} not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</verse>
    <verse number="14">For all the law is fulfilled in one word, {even} in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
    <verse number="15">But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</verse>
    <verse number="16">{This} I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. {ye...: or, fulfil not}</verse>
    <verse number="17">For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</verse>
    <verse number="18">But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</verse>
    <verse number="19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are {these}; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</verse>
    <verse number="20">Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</verse>
    <verse number="21">Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told {you} in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
    <verse number="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</verse>
    <verse number="23">Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</verse>
    <verse number="24">And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. {affections: or, passions}</verse>
    <verse number="25">If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</verse>
    <verse number="26">Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter number="6">
    <verse number="1">Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. {if: or, although}</verse>
    <verse number="2">Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</verse>
    <verse number="3">For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</verse>
    <verse number="4">But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</verse>
    <verse number="5">For every man shall bear his own burden.</verse>
    <verse number="6">Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</verse>
    <verse number="7">Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</verse>
    <verse number="8">For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</verse>
    <verse number="9">And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</verse>
    <verse number="10">As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all {men}, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</verse>
    <verse number="11">Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.</verse>
    <verse number="12">As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</verse>
    <verse number="13">For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</verse>
    <verse number="14">But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. {by whom: or, whereby}</verse>
    <verse number="15">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</verse>
    <verse number="16">And as many as walk according to this rule, peace {be} on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
    <verse number="17">From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
    <verse number="18">Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ {be} with your spirit. Amen. «{To the} Galatians written from Rome.»</verse>
